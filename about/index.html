<p>Girlcheese because of a particularly odd late-night discussion in Bradford some eleventy-one years ago. Mammary fluid, because it is that from which cheese is made. And I've got to give credit to <a title="Hexstatic guerilla gig" href="https://vimeo.com/3822106" target="_blank">Hexstatic</a> and <a title="Weeble's Stuff" href="http://www.weebls-stuff.com/toons/chase+me/" target="_blank">Weebl</a> for the slogan; "Have you tried cheese yet? It's made from mammary fluids".</p>
<p>I'm a web developer with 20 years experience of online and digital media, born in, and now based in London. I have no more of an unhealthy interest in human milk than any other man. Honest.</p>
