<p>A new venue! It appears to be really very new. In fact the reason for the long queue outside was revealed once I read the nearby sandwich board. "50% Off burritos this week". I was curious. Curious as to how a pleasant quality meaty Calippo could be delivered to my food hole for the minimal sum of &pound;2.75.</p>
<p>Lets assume it's a loss leader, I thought, and not concern ourselves with the quality before eating it. For that would quite literally be prejudice, after all. Once nearer the establishment I could tell that the queue was not in fact as long as I had feared, and I was asked for my selection from their menu as soon as I entered the place. With a good number of staff ladling on fillings to the flour tortillas I was hopeful I would be in and out quickly.</p>
<p>Back to the options. There are a bewildering array of meaty choices available ranging from Texas chilli to (!)Chicken Tikka(?). I'm not sure that's the kind of fusion I can get behind. I went for my standard first benchmark of an establishment and opted for the Carnitas - 12 hour cooked pulled pork, apparently. Refreshingly they also offered some more interesting veggie options that the standard Fajita veg with Guac which most places opt for. Two rice options as well - "Mexican" and lime &amp; coriander.</p>
<p>The refried beans appeared to be a mushier version of the black bean option - more akin to the refritos I was familiar with as an&nbsp;accompaniment&nbsp;to huevos rancheros for breakfast in Mexico. I thought I'd give them a bash, despite the fact that pinto beans really do go better with pork (there didn't appear to be a pinto bean option).</p>
<p>Hot sauce and guacamole top off my lunch and I head back to the office.&nbsp;I chow down. The filling seems remarkably low temperature given the indoor, under glass, in a catering cabinet nature of the food prep. Come to think of it I don't recall them warming the tortilla prior to filling, which might be a contributory factor (or might just demonstrate my completely useless short term memory). The pork is a little greasy, and has more in common with a fairground hog roast meat than some sort of hickory flavoured spicy treat. I do remember them adding hot-sauce to the mound of filling but I cannot taste it. Not one bit. There's a background spicyness but the whole thing is less mouth tingling than a packet of paprika crisps. The beans are interesting but in no way flavoursome. And my worries about the partially oxidised pot of avocado are borne out by eating. The pears are ripe but the onion flaccid and the Guac follows the rest of the burrito in being fundamentally lacking in spice.</p>
<p>I finished the lunch but I was not proud of myself. I feel dirty now. I've cheated on my faithful lover by straying, seduced by novelty. If the sign is an indication of the source of the restaurant, Eatsies round the corner should stick to what they know. Too much variety of choice has led to them being good at none of the possibilities available at this new venture. And put some <strong>chillies</strong> in your hot sauce for f***'s sake.</p>

<p>I've taken advantage of the fact that I'm on the bike again to venture slightly further afield and visit the lawyer-who-is-also-a-mexican-food-fan's Mecca that is Chilango on Fleet street. I made it just in time to avoid a large blossoming of numbers in the queue, something which is characteristic of the place, even on a midweek lunchtime.</p>
<p>It's a lovely bright room which meets me once I get inside (even today the queue was out the door) - the glass partition which seperates the food prep area from the servers gives mouth watering previews of the meaty treats to come as they sizzle on the grills.</p>
<p>Having previously tried the pork and found it not to the standards of Freebird, today I opted for the steak, with Pinto beans and Guacamole. Hot salsa of course. For cycle ride back to work, I can feel the warm foil package at my spine. What treat lies in store?</p>
<p>Well, I can safely say it's a class act. Juicy and tender steak, well flavoured - with the cow coming through the sauce, in perfectly bite-sized chunks. The guacamole is really excellent, and the pinto beans are proper yummy, with a rich thick tang of sauce. I think the advantage of more space and more servers over the outdoor competition shows - the service is fast and the contents are piping hot, even after the trip I had to make with them up Fetter Lane &amp; Hatton Garden.</p>
<p>On a down note, perhaps the hot-sauce could do with a bit more pep, it's fading fast from the memory and the lips and there's no tell-tale under-eye sweats. memo to self. Eat in next time and take advantage of extra habanero sauce on the tables. I was initially worried when eating that they had been light on the meat - but I was overjoyed to discover a treasure trove of beefs hiding amongst the glorious avocados at the bottom of the burrito. A great way to end a lovely lunch. Chilango's I shall be back. Prepare the hot-sauce, and oil up the griddle.</p>
<p>(Oh and that's a parrticularly envious Stimpson J. Katt looking on over the top of the notebook)</p>

<p>Every trip to Feebird's Exmouth Market stall just reminds me why I so readily claim they're the best option round here. The pinto beans were perfect, in their delicious sauce, the lime & coriander rice shines through and binds all the other flavours. And then there's the pork; a generous portion of beautifully marinated quality shredded meat, many dimensions of flavour deeper than the competition. The hot sauce was tangy and offered up a good wedge of lunchtime endorphins. </p>
<p>I made it to the stall in good time to get guacamole too. From memory I'd say that only Chilango's comes close. Brilliant stuff today. I savoured every morsel and was so happy I even forgot the apple strudel I brought back with me from the cake stall until well into the afternoon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday's errant stray into pedestrian lunch territory is a distant memory. The tickle-scratch at the back of my throat needs addressing.  I needed Donkey Power. Strolling through the sunny south of Leather  Lane I resolved there was only one solution. Double meat and Guacamole. Wait, that's two solutions, but you get me.</p>
<p>Even before it was rolled I could tell that the mountain of shredded beef would become an epic lunch. My god it was. The telltale sweat under the eyes was just the start. Upon eventual completion of the task My eyes struggle to retain focus. Three times the size of my fist, I added the pen to show scale. I need alie down now but am off to a brainstorm instead.</p>

<p>It had to be a double-meat day after G's leaving drinks and a catch-up at my new local with some neighbours last night. So I was devestated to discover that there was insufficient meat for a double helping of Tomatillo (but not as unhappy as those behind me in the Friday queue). I was pacified and sated with an extra helping of free steak. Lovely.</p>
<p>I'm also happy to report a great tasting combination. The extra Guacamole (yes I was that greedy today) running alongside consistent beans, rice and meat along the whole length of the - slightly more plump than my waistline needed - burrito. Hot but not overpowering sauce tingling on the lips. One might even have called it a Burro.</p>
<p>That also makes it 5-for-5 two weeks on the trot. Ten Lunches. Ten Burritos. I am going to have to consider cold turkey. But I don't know anywhere I can get that in mexican snack form.</p>
