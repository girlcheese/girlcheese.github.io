<p>I've just heard Howard Rheingold speak at the NESTA Connect event "Mass Collaboration, Tools, Techniques and Foundations". Quite a milestone for me really, given that the guy is something of a luminary. For him to be speaking in my place of work was quite entertaining and he gave an idea packed presentation, as I expected.</p>
<p>Anyway I'll save full reactions until I am no longer at the office and can absorb stuff fully. This is just to say that the recording of the talk is now online and can be got from the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/nestapodcast" title="NESTA Podcast from feedburner" target="_blank">NESTA Podcast feed</a>.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can grab it directly from the server :</p>

<p>Mark Earl also gave an entertaining and informative speech relating to themes he develops in his book, "Herd". I'll be uploading that forthwith too.</p>
