<p>The <a href="http://twitter.com/elliotjaystocks/status/9227592793">tweet</a> begat a debate, which justified <a href="http://elliotjaystocks.com/blog/web-designers-who-cant-code/">a longer post</a>, which garnered <a href="http://carsonified.com/blog/uncategorized/5-good-reasons-why-designers-should-code/">a post on Carsonified</a> by Mike Kus. All in all a sensible and well argued set of points from both of them. I agree. I've always maintained a multi-disciplinary approach to the web, and I am a developer - Looking at the debate from the other side it wouldn't hurt for other developers to also acquire some "soft skills" in design. Grab some colour theory, research design trends, look at varieties of interface. We can all do with crossing the floor occasionally, both designers and developers, and understanding the work the other does.</p>
