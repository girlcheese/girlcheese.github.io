    A stylish drive into the countryside and we arrived just in time to <br />get the tents up in daylight, and enjoy a lovely Gin & Tonic with the <br />sunset. What a lovely location. I haven't managed to help much today, <br />but will no doubt be packing the daylight hours tomorrow with plenty <br />of jobs. It looks like the lucky folk first on site have been busy <br />already though, the main stage is going in and the first stakes are <br />down in the party camping field. Many more jobs are underway but this <br />does feel like the calm before the storm!
<p /> I don't want to spoil any of the wonderful surprises the place will <br />bring when you arrive. You are coming right? It's beginning to be the <br />site it soon will become. Festinho a-go-go.</p>
