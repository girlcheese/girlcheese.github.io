<p>I've taken advantage of the fact that I'm on the bike again to venture slightly further afield and visit the lawyer-who-is-also-a-mexican-food-fan's Mecca that is Chilango on Fleet street. I made it just in time to avoid a large blossoming of numbers in the queue, something which is characteristic of the place, even on a midweek lunchtime.</p>
<p>It's a lovely bright room which meets me once I get inside (even today the queue was out the door) - the glass partition which seperates the food prep area from the servers gives mouth watering previews of the meaty treats to come as they sizzle on the grills.</p>
<p>Having previously tried the pork and found it not to the standards of Freebird, today I opted for the steak, with Pinto beans and Guacamole. Hot salsa of course. For cycle ride back to work, I can feel the warm foil package at my spine. What treat lies in store?</p>
<p>Well, I can safely say it's a class act. Juicy and tender steak, well flavoured - with the cow coming through the sauce, in perfectly bite-sized chunks. The guacamole is really excellent, and the pinto beans are proper yummy, with a rich thick tang of sauce. I think the advantage of more space and more servers over the outdoor competition shows - the service is fast and the contents are piping hot, even after the trip I had to make with them up Fetter Lane &amp; Hatton Garden.</p>
<p>On a down note, perhaps the hot-sauce could do with a bit more pep, it's fading fast from the memory and the lips and there's no tell-tale under-eye sweats. memo to self. Eat in next time and take advantage of extra habanero sauce on the tables. I was initially worried when eating that they had been light on the meat - but I was overjoyed to discover a treasure trove of beefs hiding amongst the glorious avocados at the bottom of the burrito. A great way to end a lovely lunch. Chilango's I shall be back. Prepare the hot-sauce, and oil up the griddle.</p>
<p>(Oh and that's a parrticularly envious Stimpson J. Katt looking on over the top of the notebook)</p>
