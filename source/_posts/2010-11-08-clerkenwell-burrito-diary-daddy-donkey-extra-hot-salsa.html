<p>Today was the day I decided to try the extra hot salsa from Daddy D's...</p>
<p>Wow! It began with the familiar twinges on the top of my scalp from chilli and built from there. This is some cold cure, delaying a fatal blow to my disco flu from the weekend. Within minutes my nose was streaming and under-eye sweating was overtaken by endorphin laden chilli tears streaming from my eyes. One bottle of chocolate milk was rapidly consumed and I had to stagger half-blind from capsaicin induced weeping across the studio to the water cooler.</p>
<p>One hour later and the ride has mellowed to just a dull soreness of the tongue. Thankyou Daddy D for a great ride but I might take it a modicum less fiery next time if only to enable me to taste the other ingredients!</p>
