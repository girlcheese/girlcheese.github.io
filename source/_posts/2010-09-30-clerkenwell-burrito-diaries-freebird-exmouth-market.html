<p>I'd already eaten more than half way through when I realised I should take a photo. The Carnitas was back on and definitely up to standard; juicy, flavoursome and tender. Rice was lovely, and reminded me again why I love Freebird above all others. But unfortunately the beans were a little wet and the burrito was packed a little loosely. Perhaps due to the new staff member on frontline duties? Who knows.</p>
<p>Either way - service with a smile, quick without hurry, hot and tasty with lovely guacamole.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still the best option in EC1. In my humble and well satisfied opinion.</p>
