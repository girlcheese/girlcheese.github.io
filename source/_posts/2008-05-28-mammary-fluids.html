<p>Well I've belatedly discovered that <a href="http://www.weebls-stuff.com/" title="Weebl's Stuff" target="_blank">Weebl</a> was responsible for the animated <a href="http://www.hexstatic.tv" title="Hexstatic Myspace" target="_blank">Hexstatic</a> video which gave this blog its name. The song was Chase Me (from Master View) and <a href="http://www.weebls-stuff.com/toons/chase+me/" title="view the running ninja" target="_blank">the animation is available for your viewing pleasure</a> on Weebl's site. I'm glad I squared that circle.</p>
<p>Oh and Hexstatic also appear to have posted <a href="http://videos.hexstatic.tv/medmix.mp3" title="Medmix" target="_blank">a lovely new mix</a> up on their site.</p>
