<p>Apparently, 52 percent of senior people in the dairy industry feel that <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article1733899.ece" title="Times Online" target="_blank">the government is anti-cheese</a>. This is disheartening news, and presumably goes some way to explaining their dismal performance in the latest local elections.</p>
<p>Iraq you say? No. Definitely the cheese. Thanks to the <a href="http://www.demos.co.uk/blog/cheesedoff" title="Demos Blog" target="_blank">Demos blog</a> for the link.</p>
