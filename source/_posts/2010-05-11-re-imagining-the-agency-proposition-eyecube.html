<p>Will agencies of today be there?</p>
</div>
<p>A recurring theme for the last year or so has been the thoughtful essay – or call to arms – to rethink the role, make-up and/or organization of the agency. New technologies, the global economic climate and the evolution of an empowered consumer have all led to the spilling of much digital ink by a host of extremely smart people. &nbsp;I’ve read a lot of really well written pieces along these lines recently. &nbsp;<a href="http://madebymany.co.uk/author/justin-mcmurray">Justin McMurray</a> from Made by Many had <a href="http://madebymany.co.uk/a-manifesto-for-agile-strategy-oxymoron-or-innovation-003406">a great piece</a> that built upon that agencies <a href="http://madebymany.co.uk/category/agile">“Agile”</a> claims. The main thrust is a call to action that emphasizes testing, simplicity and responding to change over deep research, insights and long decks. </p>
