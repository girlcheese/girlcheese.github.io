<p>And I've only contemplated murder once during that time. Things that have been taking up my leisure time are <a title="London Rollergirls" href="http://www.londonrollergirls.com/" target="_blank">Roller Derby</a>, Bicycle maintenance and <a title="My flickr photostream" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gwawr247/tags/eine" target="_blank">Eine letters</a>.</p>
<p>London Rollergirls are an awesome evening's entertainment and I am sure to be back there in December for their next Jam. It was one of those occasions where you manage to bump into loads of people you know, and a great way to spend a Saturday.</p>
