<p>Yesterday's errant stray into pedestrian lunch territory is a distant memory. The tickle-scratch at the back of my throat needs addressing.  I needed Donkey Power. Strolling through the sunny south of Leather  Lane I resolved there was only one solution. Double meat and Guacamole. Wait, that's two solutions, but you get me.</p>
<p>Even before it was rolled I could tell that the mountain of shredded beef would become an epic lunch. My god it was. The telltale sweat under the eyes was just the start. Upon eventual completion of the task My eyes struggle to retain focus. Three times the size of my fist, I added the pen to show scale. I need alie down now but am off to a brainstorm instead.</p>
