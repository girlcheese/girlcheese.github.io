<p><a title="BBC Blog for Saturday Live" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/saturdaylive/2007/02/dave_gorman_1.html">Radio 4 this morning</a> (<a title="RealMedia file" href="http://fileho.com/download/5c9853725324/saturdaylive.rm.html">Download</a> - 24'20" in to the hour) has managed to remind me of an amusing discovery I made last year while wandering around the web. It's just the sort of tangental wander that I wish I had time to make more of, and one of the reasons I love the web.</p>
<p>While <a title="Scrawl Collective" href="http://www.scrawlcollective.co.uk/" target="_blank">working</a> for a <a title="Start" href="http://www.startcreative.co.uk/">great agency</a>, I began discussing the <a title="Pictures on Walls" href="http://www.picturesonwalls.com/Art_Artists.asp?Artist=Eine&amp;Offset=0&amp;PageNo=1" target="_blank">EINE</a> letters with one of the staff who like me, lived in that part of East London scattered with them. He had purchased a poster of the entire alphabet, and though I had seen a lot of them, I realised I had no idea where to find <a title="26 EINE letters at daytime" href="http://www.artofthestate.co.uk/Graffiti/eine_graffiti.htm" target="_blank">all 26</a>.</p>
<p>So I went surfing. Flickr being an obvious first call I dropped in and hit paydirt almost immediately. Fellow East Londoner <a title="Dave Gorman's website" href="http://www.davegorman.com/" target="_blank">Dave Gorman</a> had collected <a title="Dave Gorman's night time collection" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dgbalancesrocks/85439592/" target="_blank">his own load of letters</a> over 3 nights and uploaded the results to his quite popular photostream. And then I noticed the username; "dgbalancesrocks". It occured to me that the latter part of the username must be fairly significant if it had relegated his name to simply initials.That's how I found out about <a title="Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_balancing" target="_blank">rock balancing</a>.</p>
<p>Aside from the fact that I think Dave has a fantastic eye for detail, and takes some really lovely photos of things around and about my area (I'm liking the collection of <a title="Flickr Search" href="http://www3.flickr.com/search/?q=dscreet&amp;w=all&amp;s=int" target="_blank">dscreet owls</a>, many of which cover the same parts of town as the EINE letters), and further afield, he also, it seems, <a title="Dave's favourite rock balances" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dgbalancesrocks/sets/1572008/" target="_blank">balances rocks</a>. I fear have neither the patience nor the sense of balance required for this most zen of pass-times. From street art to beach art, via Bethnal Green, a journey in a lunchtime remembered.</p>
