My replacement PC parts don't yet seem to be playing ball, but at least the weather looks good for the weekend. That should help me forget that I've just spent hundreds of pounds on cutting edge technology which does nothing but beep at me when I turn it on.</p>
<p>Thank goodness for warranties. And festivals.</p>
