<p>It's been a while since I cycled anything like a long distance in one go - and this weekend I tested my knees, lungs and new bike in aid of <a title="Action Aid fundraising site" href="http://www.myactionaid.org.uk/emmas/london-to-brighton-cycle" target="_blank">getting kids in Uganda through school</a>.</p>
<p>I <a href="http://girlcheese.posterous.com/and-we-thought-this-was-the-end-of-the-tough" target="_blank">posted</a> a couple of images while on the road, and will dump a couple more once I can get them off my useless phone.</p>
<p>It was a very rewarding day - a long ride, through some beautiful parts of Southern England. The weather was kind, and we had a lot of fun. As well as burning many calories I'm pretty sure I consumed a fair number due to all the energy bars and drinks I sank - and the pub lunch of course.</p>
<p>Discovery of the day for me was Dark Star Hophead. A delicious beer. Brewed only a few miles from the <a title="The Royal Oak" href="http://www.theaa.com/pubs/wineham-the-royal-oak-374875" target="_blank">excellent pub in Wineham</a> where we stopped for lunch.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://girlcheese.posterous.com/london-to-brighton-route-map" target="_blank">route we chose</a> meant that we opted for a climb around Devil's Dyke rather than Ditchling Beacon. This was chosen in order to make the last section of the ride less daunting - but it was still quite a challenging bit of hill, believe me. I'd definitely do the ride again, and I'd use that route again too - once we were past the M25 it really came into it's own. Beautiful.</p>
<p>All in all we've now raised over Â£3000 for Action Aid. It definitely makes the sore knees less painful knowing that. Thanks to everyone who pledged support.</p>
