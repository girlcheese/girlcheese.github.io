<p>From the Hive mind, I've collected a - growing - Spotify playlist of lovely tunes from friends. Some of my absolute favourite tunes are held within, including the awesome "You're Losing Me" and the equally amazing "Come on Train".</p>

<p>It currently leans quite heavily on Soul and Funk but I'm sure some Disco will emerge from the woodwork in time as we get our heads together.</p>
