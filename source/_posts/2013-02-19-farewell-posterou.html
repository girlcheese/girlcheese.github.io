<p>It was inevitable I guess but after <a href="http://blog.posterous.com/thanks-from-posterous" target="_blank">last Friday's announcement</a> from the Twitter-acquired blogging platform, I've imported all my posts and content from my old domain and dumped them here. *sadface* I liked posterous. It's low friction posting mechanics and following structure were good things and although it was later to the party than the bigger and prettier Tumblr, it appealed to me. Designed by engineers it may have been (maybe that's why it appealed!) but it was a decent platform, and has 5 years of good content upon it, which will disappear in a little over a month.</p>
<p>This is now the home of the Clerkenwell Burrito Diary (now I'm no longer working in Clerkenwell, just Plain Old Burrito Diary I guess), and all the other <del>random crap</del>glorious internuggets I shared there.</p>
