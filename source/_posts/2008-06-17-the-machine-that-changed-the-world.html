<p>Waxy.org have posted online all the episodes of this documentary, which I'd not seen before, but which is fascinating in a thoroughly geeky and pre-intertube way:</p>
<p><a href="http://waxy.org/2008/06/the_machine_that_changed_the_world/">The Machine That Changed the World: Great Brains - Waxy.org</a></p>
<p>So far I'm just into episode II, dealing with ENIAC and the breakthrough of computing machines into business. Thankfully I'm not quite old enough to remember punch-cards.</p>
