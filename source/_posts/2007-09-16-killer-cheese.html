<p>The Guardian report of a new drug called cheese. It sounds pretty rank and not like any dairy product I'd like to sample.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,,2165362,00.html" title="Guardian news story" target="_blank">Cheese-like heroin killing Texan teens</a></p>
<p>This will do nothing for the reputation of the wonderful stuff whose name they've nicked. I'd far rather it was known as "Joss Ackland's Spunky Backpack" instead.</p>
