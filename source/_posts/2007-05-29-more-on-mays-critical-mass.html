<p>Some <a href="http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/regions/london/2007/05/371610.html" title="Indymedia" target="_blank">excellent photos</a> on IndyMedia this month (including one shot of the cricket moment), as well as some interesting comments on the behaviour of the massers. Respect for pedestrians and intelligent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Mass#.22Corking.22" title="organise yourself" target="_blank">corking</a> is a massive part of what makes CM good, and fluid. Personally, I go for a ride, not for a "stand around and wait" and things that enhance the former and reduce the latter are fine by me.</p>
