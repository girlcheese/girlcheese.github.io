So while the TV shows propaganda shots of leaders meeting and pointing into the middle distance, it's heartening to know that some folks out there are at least managing to express the collective roar of discontent which seems so necessary right now. And apart from anything there are a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.spiegel.de/fotostrecke/0,5538,PB64-SUQ9MjIxOTImbnI9MTI_3,00.html" title="Peace vs...">striking</a> set of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.welt.de/politik/article924395/Wasserwerfer_Traenengas_Polizei_erklaert_Deeskalationsstrategie_fuer_gescheitert.html" title="WELT online">images of protest</a> and determined resistance being produced.</p>
