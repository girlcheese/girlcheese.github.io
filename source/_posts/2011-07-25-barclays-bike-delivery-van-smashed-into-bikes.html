  content: I'm just hoping there isn't too much damage to the bikes. They didn't seem
    too mangled. It remains to be seen if they're rideable.

    picture or point out to the driver what had happened? If you left a note on the
    bikes surely you will have seen what damage was left.Looking at the picture the
    truck is close but it doesn't show any damage.

  content: One of the bikes was actually that of one of my team members, I discovered
    on leaving the office this evening. I wasn't overly confrontational with the driver
    at the time of the incident, but I made it clear I would be posting images online
    and leaving notes. He saw me taking photos. I mainly wanted to identify the vehicle
    having done the damage.My colleague's bike had it's pedal torn and bent, the crank
    still appeared to function, but I would worry on the general health of the drive
    train and frame after being scrunched like it was. I hope he was able to ride
    it home safely.

  content: I would also say that it was a low speed accident. And the position in
    which you see the trailer is after it had passed the stands and the driver got
    out to inspect things.

<p>If your bike is one of the ones parked on the Sheffield Stands on the North end of Hatton Garden, I'd make a careful inspection and if there's any damage (it was quite a crunch the impact made) take it up with TfL/Serco. Van registration MX10 NGZ. I'll be leaving a note on the two which bore the brunt of the impact shortly...
