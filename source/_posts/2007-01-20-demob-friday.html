<p>Everyone got very demob happy at work yesterday afternoon. Some sort of collective madness overtook us all. I___ seemed to want to wear a pot of flowers on his head Carmen Miranda style, and the Comms team were understandably distracted by videos of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlFEG-97xUM" target="_blank" title="YouTube">sneezing pandas</a>. The <a href="http://www.thoughtfarmer.com/blog/?page_id=11" title="Chris McGrath" target="_blank">jovial Canadian</a> who presented <a href="http://www.thoughtfarmer.com/" title="Thoughtfarmer" target="_blank">Thoughtfarmer</a> to us in the afternoon helped too. It's a very well engineered product, but getting the company to accept the shift in psyche involved in adoption of it or a product like it will be tricky. The <a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/" title="people of earth..." target="_blank">Cluetrain Manifesto</a> really should be required reading for CTO, CEO and COO by now.</p>
<p>But I think it was the fact it was Friday. Simple really.</p>
