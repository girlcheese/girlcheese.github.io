<p><img src="http://www.evanscycles.com/product_images/Z1498Z.jpg" title="Specialized Sirrus Pro" alt="Specialized Sirrus Pro" align="left" height="156" hspace="10" width="250" style="border:0px;margin-right:10px;" />A new bike to replace the one stolen last week, and its arrival has cheered me up no end, deciding as I did to go up the range to console myself. First ride on it this morning. So, I leap on, all togged up and ready for an entertaining ride to work. And I can't clip in to my pedals. And for 30 minutes I'm slipping off them in annoying metal-on-metal-in-rain ways. And at every lights I have a false start because I can't lift accelerate. Every attempt to clip in, at any angle or force fails.</p>
<p>So I get to work and do a quick search and (nesto, this might be relevant to you to...) it would appear that the SPD cleats I have in my shoes are not compatible with the crank brothers clip pedals fitted to the new bike.</p>
<p>And a pair of cleats is going to cost me frickin Â£18 :/. And that's if I'm able to remove the thoroughly gritted-in ones already on my shoes.</p>
<p>This message comes to you from the "should have bought Shimano M520 after all" dept.</p>
