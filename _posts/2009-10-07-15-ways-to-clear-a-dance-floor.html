    A <a href="http://bit.ly/1bZcQX">great &#39;opinion piece&#39; from Daniel Wang</a> - lists 15 records which can clear a dance floor in the wrong room. Some great choices. Ticks all my buttons does this. The <a href="http://bit.ly/UsoXT">discussion from DJ History</a> which pointed me at it is also pretty funny.</p>
