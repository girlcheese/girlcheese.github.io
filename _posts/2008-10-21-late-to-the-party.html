<p>I may be a latecomer to this particular social tool, although it's been on my Radar for some time - but <a href="http://weheartit.com" target="_blank">weheartit.com</a> is a great site. I'm having trouble using it at work though, given the frequently explicit nature of the images people seem to bookmark. <a href="http://ffffound.com/" target="_blank">ffffound</a> is a much more purely "arty" service in a similar vein.</p>
<p>Plus I wonder what the etiquette is with regard to <a href="http://weheartit.com/entry/152981" target="_blank">hearting your own images</a>? A touch vain perhaps, but I couldn't help it :)</p>
