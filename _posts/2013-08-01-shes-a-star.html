<p>Our <a href="http://instagram.com/photostu1">lovely friend Stuart</a> has <a title="Lovelight Photography" href="http://www.lovelightphoto.co.uk/">a lovely new photography business</a>. And <a href="http://www.lovelightphoto.co.uk/adventures-with-ada/">my daughter</a> was lucky enough to have some photos taken and be featured in the site on launch. We're very impressed with the results. Ada enjoyed her day no end, and the photos we'll treasure forever.</p>
<p>Thanks Lovelight, and thanks Stu!</p>
