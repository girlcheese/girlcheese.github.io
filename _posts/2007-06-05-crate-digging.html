<p>As a change from the many house dominated <a href="http://www.headphonesex.co.uk/" title="Headphone Sex" target="_blank">mp3 blogs</a> out there I was delighted to find <a href="http://fleamarketfunk.wordpress.com/" title="All the funk, no waiting" target="_blank">Flea Market Funk</a>. A refreshing change, and a lovely collection of 7" recommendations. With some lovely mp3s to go with. The author has even started a <a href="http://fleamarketfunk.podomatic.com/rss2.xml" title="RSS(xml) Link" target="_blank">podcast with some rather juicy mixes</a>. So what are you waiting for? get down after the jump.</p>
