<p>Long time no post. It's been a busy few months and no mistake. Although not strictly cheese related, I felt I just had to share <a href="http://londonreviewofbreakfasts.blogspot.com/" title="Get it down your neck" target="_blank">The London Review of Breakfasts</a>. Great reviews, on a great subject, one dear to my heart. Not deeming it sufficient simply to review the food in question, most of the reviewers also recount the state of their minds at the time of the breakfast. Call it metaphysical reviewing. Whatever you call it, it works for me.  A good bunch of folks with an unhealthy outlook on life, and a great love of the first meal of the day.</p>
<p>I can't help but think that <a href="http://londonreviewofbreakfasts.blogspot.com/2006/01/e-pellicci-bethnal-green.html" title="E Pellici" target="_blank">Pellici's</a> got a bit of harsh treatment though. Having said that, I wouldn't know what their breakfast is like, since I only ever eat Cannelloni and chips there. But oh what chips.</p>
