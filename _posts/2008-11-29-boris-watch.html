    to yours :)

<p>In a (possibly vain, given this blog's readership - or lack thereof) attempt to improve the visibility of the site, I'm following Mia's advice and linking to <a title="Boris Johnson, Boriswatch" href="http://www.boriswatch.co.uk/" target="_blank">an excellent site about London's Mayor</a>. He's the worst thing to happen to my city for years, and I'm really rather worried about the next four years. <a href="http://www.boriswatch.co.uk/" target="_blank">Mia puts it far better</a> than I could.</p>
