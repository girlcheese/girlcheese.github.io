  content: I used this one recently:"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken
    idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete
    account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer
    of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes,
    or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not
    know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely
    painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain
    of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in
    which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example,
    which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some
    advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses
    to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain
    that produces no resultant pleasure?‚Äù   Think I just googled and found it. x

  content: Aye Bella that's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum#English_translation"
    rel="nofollow">the original "Lorem ipsum" quote</a> translated from the latin
    to English, I believe.

<p>There's <a href="http://www.lipsum.com/" title="Lipsum dot com" target="_blank">the original</a> of course, but as well as that there are now a number of others. Here's a list of my favourites. In other words, all the ones I know about. Does anyone have others to add to the list?</p>
<p>Edit: <em>It appears I missed <a href="http://girlcheese.posterous.com/samuel-l-ipsum" target="_self">Slipsum</a> off - thanks Steve :)</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.lipsum.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Lipsum.com</strong><br /></a>Classic and timeless. You'll often find it mistakenly added to live content the world over. Comes complete with a little history lesson on the origins of the text (Cicero, 45BC, folks).</p>
