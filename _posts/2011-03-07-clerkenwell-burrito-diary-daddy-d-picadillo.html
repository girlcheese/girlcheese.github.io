<p>I'm really not sure why I strayed from the usual tomatillo beef but it was a useful diversion. Moist meat but not wet meant the burrito held together well, and the flavours came through well too, probably because I opted for the medium corn salsa and not the hot. Also added one of the extras which seem to have recently appeared alongside the guacamole, so the wrap included some roasted seeds. Combined with the corn this gave the little donkey some much needed variation of texture and taste. I'll be back, daddy dee, but I'll no doubt return to my favourite when I do.</p>
