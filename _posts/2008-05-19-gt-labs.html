<p>Off the back of the presentation at <a href="http://www.offf.ws/#/artists/gt-london/" title="The Artist page for GT at the OFFF site" target="_blank">OFFF Lisbon</a> earlier this month, where Stuart, Ben and Stephen presented <a href="http://www.rhythmoflines.co.uk/" title="Audi's Rhythm of Lines site" target="_blank">Rhythm of Lines</a>, GT have launched their <a href="http://labs.wearegt.co.uk/" title="GT Labs. Where cool shit happens" target="_blank">GT Labs website</a>, where cool stuff will be dropping every month or so, to demonstrate things that we do and to open up some of our work to wider communities for use and re-use.</p>
<p>The R.o.L code released there last week is GPL'ed and doesn't represent the entire code base for the project but does give enough away to demonstrate working end to end from Maya into Flash and Papervision.</p>
<p>Though the project work represented there took place before I joined GT, it represents something I'm happy to shout about; a successful technical project which is aesthetically beautiful. It encourages play and user-engagement, and has rightly won awards and accolades.</p>
<p>I look forward to adding to the GT Labs contributions some time in the near future.</p>
