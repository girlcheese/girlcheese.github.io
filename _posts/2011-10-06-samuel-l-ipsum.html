<p>Here's one I missed! (via&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/joeandsteve" target="_blank">Steve Buss</a>)</p>
<p><a href="http://slipsum.com/" target="_blank"><strong>slipsum.com</strong><br /></a>For all your expletive laden bad-ass boilerplate copy needs.</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.</p>
