<p>Former EFF employee, current boing-boing co-editor and sci-fi author discusses freedom, legislation and the information age. He covers the inaccuracies of futurology, and the unexpected revelations that real innovations bring, and discusses his book "Overclocked: Stories of the Future Present". It's a long one, and I'll confess to not having watched until the end of the 56th minute before posting it, but this looks like a Good Thing(tm).</p>
